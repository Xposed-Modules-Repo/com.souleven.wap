# WAPlusXposed

WAPlusXposed is a lightweight, efficient Xposed/LSPosed module designed to inject into and unlock premium customization features within WhatsApp. By utilizing dynamic APK analysis, the module seamlessly hooks target verification routines without relying on hardcoded offsets.


## [Source Code](https://github.com/RevealedSoulEven/WAPlusXposed)

## Features

* Unlocks premium customization features including exclusive visual themes, native app launcher icons, premium sticker packs, custom ringtones, and much more.
* **Optimized Execution:** Uses DexKit to dynamically scan the target application combined with a robust caching manager to ensure fast initialization and compatibility across application updates.

---

## Requirements

* A rooted Android device or an environment supporting hook frameworks.
* **LSPosed Framework** (or a compatible Xposed implementation) installed and active.

---

## Installation

1.  Download and install the latest `WAPlusXposed` APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/RevealedSoulEven/WAPlusXposed/releases) section.
2.  Open your **LSPosed** manager application.
3.  Navigate to the modules section, locate **WAPlus**, and toggle **Enable Module**.
5.  Force close or restart WhatsApp to apply the hooks.

## Technical Overview

The module operates using two primary layers:
* **DexKit Bridge:** Utilizes the DexKit library to scan the runtime APK on a fresh launch or update to locate targeted validation signatures dynamically.
* **Caching Manager:** Stores identified class and method signatures locally to bypass the scanning phase on subsequent launches.

## Special Thanks

This project would not be possible without the incredible work done by the developers of the core hooking and analysis libraries:

* **[DexKit](https://github.com/LuckyPray/DexKit)** - For providing the powerful, high-performance APK signature searching capabilities.
* **[LSPosed](https://github.com/LSPosed)** - For the modern, cutting-edge ART hooking framework implementation.
* **[rovo89](https://github.com/rovo89/xposed)** - For the foundational revolutionary Xposed Framework that inspired modern Android modding.
